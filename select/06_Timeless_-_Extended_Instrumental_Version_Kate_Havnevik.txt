Timeless
Love is cure
A promise
Still so pure
Rise like a tide
No need to hide
Fearless
Just like before

Ohh
Here we go
They're all waiting for a cure

Breathe in
And let go
I've seen
How you crawl
Flicker and hover
Still changing colours
But nothing
Can break this call

Ohh
Here we go
They're all waiting for a cure
Ohh
Here we go
They're all waiting for a cure
