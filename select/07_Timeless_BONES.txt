I think it's funny how they change up
Sesh dipped in diamonds, if you go blind then you could blame us
We hit the perfect spot without even aiming
Shit make me kek thinking about the basement now
No, you don't want to face me now, no, you cannot take the realm that I be in
Promise your ass cannot stand the heat, let alone actually stand to me
You're not even a man you see, boy I'ma show you how it is
How you don't finish school
How you ditch what you knew
Die for the first time and start again
Timeless, I gotta make it timeless
Everything I touch I got the touch that got 'em wilding
Timeless, I gotta make it timeless
Everything I touch I got the touch that got 'em wilding
When the circle's running again
Never could you get to us, could you get to us
When the circle's running again
Never could you get to us, could you get to us
Got that look up on your face like my time's coming soon
I just want to let you know you couldn't be further from the truth
And I hope you feel every syllable, I cannot sleep until I know that you know
That you are the worst shit around, I hope you go forever running around
Thinking that you're hard until you can finally realize
That false hopes scurry when you have to carry them
Timeless, I gotta make it timeless
Everything I touch I got the touch that got 'em wilding
Timeless, I gotta make it timeless
Everything I touch I got the touch that got 'em wilding
Timeless, timeless
Timeless
I am just so timeless
It's a shame that you can't see me
