The way you trot with your stride
That lovely hair those beautiful eyes
Doesn't take a fool to realize
That I've fallen for your clever disguise

Oh sweetie belle yeah
What will it take for me to get to you
Oh sweetie bell yeah
My heart's forever true
What will it take for me to plant that seed of love
Deep inside your mind and steal
Your breath away from you

Sugar cube you're the apple of my eye
Another sharp thorn in my soft side
Cause just the thought of you is enough to drive me crazy
And send me singing through the night

Now know that I'm deeply in love
And that may sound insane
But girl without you in my life I could never be the same
And if you are my Rarity then I am your Spike
So give me just one chance to show that
I can love and treat you right
