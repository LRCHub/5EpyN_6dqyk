As I move along
The days dissapear
And as another day
Goes over the horizon

We are more than friends
In our hearts and in our minds
There's nothing better
Than the music in your soul

And as moon arise
Tell me the secrets of life
A place where I find myself

You're touchin' my soul here within
Deep and intimate
This is the place we began
Just like the sound of time
You're touching my heart here again
Now that we can see
The river that flows within
Your soul tells me

Life is just timeless motion for you
Feel it flowing through you
