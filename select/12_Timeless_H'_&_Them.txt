Timeless
Feeling so lost under my skin
Forcing the thoughts of a nice year
Sometimes forcing the nights
Yeah
Call some of my friends
Timeless
Sometimes lost on the right tracks
Sometimes I don't call none of my friends

Fuckin Timeless
Feeling so far from a lightyear
Feeling so close to my fears
And when you get close
I'm not here
Fuck next time let's do it all now, can't wait a little bit longer
With you it's fucking timeless, some time lets...

Timeless
Feeling so lost in my head
5 pm watch the sunsets
10 pm in my bedcovers right here with you
That shit's fucking timeless
Praying i stay on my ledge
Praying i stay holding on tight
Holding on tight still
Remember in the dark how the light feels
That shit's fucking priceless
Fuck next time let's do it all now, can't wait a little bit longer
